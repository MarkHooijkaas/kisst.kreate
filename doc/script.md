# Using a minimal python script
The strukture file is always needed, and usually it should be all you need.
However originally `kreate` was more script based (originally even bash scripts).

It might still be possible to use a script and there might be cases where you
need to finetune some things that can only be done in Python.
However this is currently not actively maintained, and no garantuees are
given, that this will work.

The tests are currently broken.
